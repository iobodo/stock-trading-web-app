# Stock Trading Web App

**Introduction:**
This project aims to create a simplified stock trading platform using the Anvil platform. It will include Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies, real-time data integration, a dashboard, and some level of AI/ML for analytics. The focus is on using Python for backend operations, with Anvil providing the user interface and app logic without needing to manage complex frontend frameworks.

**Features:**
User Authentication: Use Anvil’s built-in authentication for user login.
Real-time Stock Data Integration: Integrate a stock trading API like Alpaca or a free service for real-time data.
DCA Trading Strategy: Implement DCA logic using Python.
Portfolio Management: Track and visualize stock portfolios.
Interactive Charts: Use Anvil’s built-in charting tools or integrate with TradingView.
Real-time Notifications: Anvil’s background tasks and email/SMS integration.
Basic ML/AI Analytics: Use Python libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow for ML insights.
**Tech Stack:**
Platform: Anvil (Full-stack Python, no need for separate frontend/backend).
Backend: Python (Flask-like functionality in Anvil’s server modules).
Database: Anvil’s Data Tables or PostgreSQL (if required).
Real-time Data: API Integration with services like Alpaca, IEX, or Yahoo Finance.
Charting: Anvil Plotly charts or TradingView widget integration.
**Setup:**
Sign up for Anvil:

Visit Anvil and sign up for a free account.
Create a New App:

Use one of Anvil's starter templates for dashboard applications.
Add authentication by enabling user login in the app’s settings.
Database Setup:

Use Anvil’s Data Tables for user portfolios, stock history, and transaction records.
Optionally, connect to an external PostgreSQL database if needed using Anvil's built-in database integration.
API Integration:

Use Python libraries to fetch stock data from APIs like Alpaca or IEX and display them in the app.
DCA Strategy:

Implement your DCA logic in Anvil server modules using Python, including trade execution and updates.
Charting:

Integrate real-time data charts using Anvil’s Plotly chart components.
Alternatively, embed TradingView widgets for advanced stock charting.
Notifications:

Use Anvil’s background tasks and email services for real-time trade updates.
**Development Plan:**
Week 1-2: Project Setup and Authentication

Set up the Anvil app with basic navigation, authentication, and data tables for users and portfolios.
Week 3-4: DCA Logic and Stock Data Integration

Implement the DCA strategy in Python and fetch stock data from an API using Anvil’s server modules.
Week 5-6: Portfolio Management and Notifications

Build portfolio tracking features and set up background tasks for real-time notifications.
Week 7-8: Charting and Visualization

Use Plotly for charting or integrate TradingView for stock charts and visualization.
Week 9-10: AI/ML Analytics

Add basic analytics using machine learning to help with insights like predicting optimal buy/sell points.
**Deployment:**
Anvil handles deployment automatically. Once the app is ready, publish it using Anvil’s hosting services or deploy it on your own server with Anvil’s Uplink.
