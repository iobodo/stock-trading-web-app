## Introduction

This project is part of a personal learning journey to sharpen skills in web development, data analytics, and future integration of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. The goal is to build a professional-grade web app that allows users to manage their stock portfolios, implement DCA strategies, and visualize data with TradingView.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- Real-time stock data integration
- DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) trading strategy
- Portfolio management
- Interactive charts with TradingView
- Real-time notifications and updates
- Future ML/AI capabilities for advanced data analysis

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Real-time Data:** WebSockets
- **API Integration:** Trading platform APIs (e.g., Alpaca)
- **Charting:** TradingView Charting Library

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- PostgreSQL
- Git

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <your-github-repo-url>
   cd stock-trading-web-app
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL:**

   - Install PostgreSQL from [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - Create a new database and user
   - Update the database configuration in `server.js` or in a `.env` file

4. **Run the server:**

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

5. **Frontend setup:**

   - Create a new React app inside the project directory:

     ```bash
     npx create-react-app client
     cd client
     ```

   - Install frontend dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

6. **Run the frontend:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the backend server by running:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```bash
